# Sharp transitions in phytoplankton communities across estuarine to open ocean waters of the tropical Pacific

Tucker, S.J., Rii, Y.M., Freel, K.C., Kotubetey, K., Kawelo, A.H., Winter, K.B., Rappé, M.S., Sharp transitions in phytoplankton communities across estuarine to open ocean waters of the tropical Pacific. In prep. 

Inundated by oligotrophic oceanic waters, the nearshore waters of tropical islands in the Pacific are characterized as an area of sharp physiochemical and biological transitions and provide a crucial hotspot of biodiversity and biological productivity. Despite its importance, the fine-scale spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton enhancement and phytoplankton community composition across estuarine to open ocean systems in the tropical Pacific is not well understood. Through the Kāneʻohe Bay Time-series (KByT) we characterize the biogeochemistry, phytoplankton biomass, and phytoplankton community and diversity via chloroplast and cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metagenomics, across coastal Kāneʻohe Bay, Hawaiʻi, including within an estuarine Hawaiian Fishpond, and the adjacent offshore environment. Through comparisons with the Hawaii Ocean Time-series’s Station ALOHA located in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre we elucidate the distinct phytoplankton communities and biogeochemical features that form across the nearshore to adjacent offshore (<6 km) and in open-ocean waters (>100km away). We identified remarkably persistent, multi-year transitions in surface ocean biogeochemistry, phytoplankton biomass, and phytoplankton community structure, despite high water exchange.  We also reveal spatially distinct seasonal responses in phytoplankton biomass and community composition and elucidate unique drivers of phytoplankton dynamics between nearshore and offshore waters. This ecosystem-level time-series approach provides a foundation for quantifying deviations from baseline conditions, especially as marine food webs near islands within the tropical Pacific may be particularly impacted by the increasing stratification of surrounding open ocean waters.
