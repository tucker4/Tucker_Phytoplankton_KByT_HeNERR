# Sharp transitions in phytoplankton communities across the coastal to open-ocean continuum in the tropical Pacific Ocean

Tucker, S.J., Rii, Y.M., Freel, K.C., Kotubetey, K., Kawelo, A.H., Winter, K.B., Rappé, M.S., Sharp transitions in phytoplankton communities across the coastal to open-ocean continuum in the tropical Pacific Ocean. In prep. 

Inundated by oligotrophic oceanic waters, the nearshore waters of tropical islands in the Pacific are characterized as an area of sharp physiochemical and biological transitions and provide a crucial hotspot of biodiversity and biological productivity. Despite its importance, the fine-scale spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton enhancement and phytoplankton community composition across estuary to open-ocean systems in the tropical Pacific is not well understood. Through the Kāneʻohe Bay Time-series (KByT) we characterize the biogeochemistry, phytoplankton biomass, and phytoplankton community and diversity via chloroplast and cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metagenomics, across coastal Kāneʻohe Bay, Hawaiʻi, including within an estuarine Hawaiian Fishpond, and the adjacent offshore environment. Through comparisons with the Hawaii Ocean Time-series’s Station ALOHA located in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre we elucidate the distinct phytoplankton communities and biogeochemical features that form across the nearshore to adjacent offshore (<6 km) and in open-ocean waters (>100km away).

## Directory Information

**analysis folder**
Includes code and necessary input/output files for code.
Divided into three subdirectories: Figures & Analyses (which includes analyses for sequence data & metadata), Metagenomics (QC, read recruitment to isolate genomes, and ANI between genomes), Qiime to Phyloseq (processing raw MiSeq reads).

**data folder**
assorted data files that are fundamental to analyses and include both input and output from analyses.
